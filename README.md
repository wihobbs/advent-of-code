# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an excellent, holiday-themed programming challenge and my personal favorite way to procrastinate studying for examinations.

Each year, I try to pick a new coding language, or one that I need brushing up on, to keep things interesting.

- 2021: C
- 2022: C++

Future candidates:
- Go
- Rust
- JavaScript
